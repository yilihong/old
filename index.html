                <div class="three_fourth">
                    <p>I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor, co-director of the <a href="https://research.wpcarey.asu.edu/digital-society/">Digital Society Initiative</a> and the PhD Program Coordinator in the <a href="https://apps.wpcarey.asu.edu/directory/people/profile.cfm?person=2255148">Department of Information Systems</a> at the <a href="https://wpcarey.asu.edu/">W. P. Carey School of Business</a> of <a href="http://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a>. I obtained my Ph.D in Management Information Systems at the Fox School of Business, Temple University, under the guidance of Dr. <a href="http://www.fox.temple.edu/mcm_people/paulpavlou/">Paul A. Pavlou</a>. Prior to my academic career, I have worked at <a href="http://www.cicc.com/index_en.xhtml?locale=en">China International Capital Corporation</a>, a large investment bank in China. Besides research and teaching as a faculty member, I am or have been an external research scientist for a number of companies, including <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">Freelancer</a>, <a href="https://fits.me/">fits.me</a>, <a href="http://www.yamibuy.com/en/">Yamibuy</a>, <a href="http://www.meishij.net/">Meishijie</a> (美食杰), <a href="https://www.portsamerica.com/">Ports America</a>, and <a href="https://www.picmonic.com/">Picmonic</a>.</p>

                    <p>My research interests are in the areas of <b>Sharing Economy</b>, <b>Online Platforms</b>, and <b>User-generated Content</b>.
